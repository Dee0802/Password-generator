# Password-generator
This is a tiny project for creating and setting a random password from the keyboard characters with user interaction and validation.This uses random library which randomly generates a password and allows the user to corroborate and select the desired password using a yes or no input. If the generated password does not satisfy the user, new passwords will be generated until the user decides to go ahead with the password.
